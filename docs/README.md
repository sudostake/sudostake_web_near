## What youâ€™ll find here
- Operator-focused guides that mirror the product: connect a wallet, prepare a vault, publish a request, fund it, and repay.
- Checklists and callouts written in clear language so teams can move quickly without cross-referencing multiple tabs.
- References for developers and analysts who need to understand contract architecture, indexing, and data models.

You can jump between roles at any time. Many organisations both borrow and lend, so every section aims to keep the full loop visible.

## Pick your starting point

### If you operate a vault
1. Start with the [architecture overview](./architecture.md) to understand how the vault contract, Firestore, and the app communicate.
2. Connect your wallet via the [sign-in flow](./features/authentication-signin-flow.md) and [register each token](./reference/token-registration.md) you plan to move.
3. Follow [Mint a vault](./guides/create-vault.md) to spin up your contract, then review [Vault actions](./features/vaults.md) to learn every control on the dashboard.
4. Launch your first borrower offer with [Open a liquidity request](./guides/opening-liquidity-request.md) and keep [Repay a loan](./guides/repay-loan.md) close for closing the loop.
5. Keep operations healthy with the [Indexing playbook](./operations/indexing.md) so data stays fresh for lenders.

### If you provide liquidity
1. Skim the [architecture overview](./architecture.md) so you know what the vault contract guarantees.
2. Confirm your wallet is registered with the lending token using [Token registration](./reference/token-registration.md).
3. Use [Discover open requests](./features/discover.md) to evaluate opportunities and [Fund a liquidity request](./guides/fund-liquidity-request.md) for the full funding flow.
4. Keep [Lender positions](./features/lender-positions.md) handy to monitor repayments, liquidation progress, and yields.
5. Review [Repay a loan](./guides/repay-loan.md) to understand what the borrower sees when principal and interest come back.
