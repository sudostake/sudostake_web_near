Docs voice and tone guide

Use this page when you write or edit `/docs`. It keeps the content friendly for everyday users while staying accurate for operators and developers.

Audience snapshots

- Everyday lender – Deposits tokens to earn yield. Comfortable with wallets, not blockchain jargon. Needs reassurance and quick answers.
- Liquidity requester – Runs a validator, DAO, or project that needs short-term liquidity. Values step-by-step flows and risk warnings before committing funds.
- Support & ops – Handles escalations from lenders/requesters. Needs precise references, but still benefits from plain-language summaries.
- Builder & integrator – Extends the product or calls APIs. Secondary audience; keep references accurate but link to external technical specs when detail gets heavy.

Voice principles

- Conversational, confident, and direct. Aim for the tone of a helpful teammate, not legal copy.
- Prefer plain words over jargon. If a technical term is unavoidable, define it the first time and add it to the shared glossary.
- Lead with the “what” and “why” before the “how”. Readers should know the payoff in the first sentence or two.
- Keep sentences under 20 words where possible. Break long explanations into short paragraphs or bullet lists.
- Avoid implied knowledge. When a step depends on setup (e.g., NEAR wallet, token balance), call it out explicitly.
- Write in active voice. Use second person (“you”) for guidance and first person plural (“we”) to describe platform actions.
- Flag risk and timing clearly. Use “Heads up:” or “If this fails:” callouts rather than burying warnings in text.

Structure patterns

- Start every doc with a TL;DR that states outcome, time cost, and requirements.
- Use task-based headings like “Before you start”, “Do this”, “Check it worked”, “If things go wrong”.
- When a step has more than four actions, break it into a table or checklist.
- Summaries belong at the top; deep reference tables follow and link back to related guides.
- End user flows with a safety net: “Need help?” section with links to support, community, or escalation paths.

Terminology preferences

- Say “connect your wallet” instead of “authenticate”.
- Say “vault” consistently; avoid swapping with “pool” or “contract”.
- Use “token” for fungible assets and “NFT” only when non-fungible specifics matter.
- Spell out acronyms on first use (e.g., “Annual Percentage Rate (APR)”).

Formatting checklist

- Bullets: max one idea per bullet, written as a sentence fragment.
- Tables: include short titles and align numerals right.
- Screenshots and diagrams: include alt text that explains what the reader should notice.
- Code or commands: wrap in fenced blocks with language hints; explain what executing them will do.

Review workflow

- Self-check: read the doc aloud once; trim anything that feels stiff.
- Peer check: ask someone outside your team (support or product) to skim for clarity.
- Update the glossary when new terms appear; add internal links from first usage.
